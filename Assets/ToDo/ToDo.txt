[ ] Refactor RoomManager

[ ] Problem with the KeyStoneManager
    It goes from KeyStoneManager to StoneManager, and from StoneManager to RoomManager
    Probably there is a better way to populate it
    m_StoneManager.KeyStoneManager.OnKeyStonesAligned += OnKeyStonesAlignedCallback;

[ ] StoneController as MonoBehaviour that controls every stone
    Each stone typa as ScriptableObject

[ ] Inputs and Sounds can already be ScriptableObjects
